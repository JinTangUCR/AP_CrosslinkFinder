## Overview
 AP_CrosslinkFinder is a MATLAB script package suitable for discovering the DNA-protein cross-links that formed between abasic (AP) site and lysine/arginine residues via Schiff base chemistry.

This program is easy to use with detailed instructions in the AP_CrosslinkFinder User Guide.PDF file.

The code is modified from the FindXL from kalisman Group (Kalisman, N.; Adams, C. M.; Levitt, M. Subunit Order of Eukaryotic TRiC/CCT Chaperonin by Cross-Linking, Mass Spectrometry, and Combinatorial Homology Modeling. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2012, 109 (8), 2884â€“2889)

And able to be modified to analyze other types of DNA-protein cross-links.

The code will be available after our work published.
